Skip the first p-1 nodes, to reach the node at position p. ie. iterate to p-1
Remember the node at position p-1 to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
Next, reverse the nodes from p to q using the same approach discussed in Reverse a LinkedList.
Connect the p-1 and q+1 nodes to the reversed sub-list.
